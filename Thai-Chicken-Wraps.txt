===================

We lighten this restaurant favorite, so you'll get a traditional Thai flavor for less than 400 calories.

Ingredients: 
-----------
4 (6-ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
4 teaspoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 seedless cucumber, halved lengthwise and sliced
3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
4 (8-inch) whole-wheat tortillas
4 tablespoons Thai-style satay peanut sauce (such as Ka-Me) 



Preparation
-----------
1. Heat a grill pan over high heat. Rub chicken breasts with oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

2. Add chicken to the pan, and reduce heat to medium. Cook 6 minutes on each side (depending on thickness of meat) or until cooked through. Remove from pan, let sit for 5 minutes, and slice diagonally into pieces.

3. Combine the cucumber slices and chopped cilantro in a bowl.

4. Assemble the wraps just before you are ready to serve. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat, and heat tortillas 15-20 seconds on each side.

5. Spread 1 tablespoon satay sauce on each tortilla. Top each with chicken slices and 1/4 of the cucumber mixture.

6. Fold in sides of tortillas, and serve immediately.
